# ReadIMU
Contains an arduino file, ReadIMU, that reads data from MPU 9150 or 9250. It uses Basic_I2C, by Brian R Taylor, to read and process raw MPU data. The Basic_I2C library should be added before starting the program. The library can be found here: https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250 

The processed data is then filtered using complementary filters and then printed to the serial monitor. The python script ReadSerial.py reads data from the serial port and stores it in output.txt. The python script requires the python serial package to be installed. The The pyhton scipt should be executed after executing the arduino code and should be terminated before terminating the asduino code. So: upload ReadIMU to arduino/Teensy -> execute ReadSerial -> terminate ReadSerial -> Terminate ReadIMU
